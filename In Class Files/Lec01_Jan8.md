autosize: true



In class and remote learning
========================================================
- If something comes up and we cannot meet in person we will move to zoom. I will try and give you notice, but there is a chance we may have a sudden change to zoom.
- Zoom sessions will be recorded for asynchronous use.
- Some prior year recordings available on gauchocast, but quality of these can be low.
- Let us know how we can help you succeed this term!


How will you access the course?
========================================================

- [Canvas](https://ucsb.instructure.com/)- syllabus, schedules, announcements, and quizzes
- [Github](https://github.com/srproulx/EEMB174_2025/) All files that you may need to download will be available here
- Canvas- Turning in assignments (turn in both Rmarkdown and pdf when submitting R work)
- Gauchocast- viewing zoom recordings
- [RStudio VM](https://eemb-174-274.lsit.ucsb.edu)- You will use RStudio via a virtual machine. assignments and demonstrations delivered here via github


What will instruction look like?
========================================================
- Online video lectures from the book author Richard McElreath
- Classroom activity: Lecture, programming demonstrations, in class exercises
- Lab: RStudio exercises
- Homework: Usually using RStudio
- Quizzes: Online through Canvas
- Exams: Midterm and Final, during lab period using RStudio

- [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) Python interface for Stan
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) Make apps to perform analysis with user input



How can you teach programming?
=========================================================
- Is it like opening a can of beans? Or is it more like giving someone a recipe book?
- We aim to get somewhere in between: 
  + Here's the can opener and some abstract guidance
  + Watch me do everything and try not to fall asleep
- When recreating code, make sure you understand each step. Try variations and see if they also work. 
- PLEASE, please, please ask questions when you don't understand or get stuck. It is the only way that I will know that I need to explain something in more detail or in a different way.
